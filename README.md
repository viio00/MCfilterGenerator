Issues/functionalities to be fixed/added:  
1. It only works on PCs (undraggable on touch screens)
2. Dragging icons/item lags
3. Icons/items may replace the main image if hovered and dragged carelessly
4. Items cannot yet be duplicated or manipulated (in terms of size)
5. No undo button
6. Saving images is unavailable; only screenshots can be taken.
